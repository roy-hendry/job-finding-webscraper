# job-finding-webscraper

A project to search through job websites and find the appropriate jobs I am searching for and send them to me via terminal.

As of current the script will obtain job information regarding: The job titles, employers of the job and the link to the page where I can apply to the job.

This is all done via the first page of Indeed, the .Gov job seeking website and reed.
